## 🚀 About This Project

This project is my initial practical work during my internship at **Elevvo Pathways**. The goal is to build a predictive model to estimate students' exam scores based primarily on their study hours and additional factors, using machine learning regression techniques.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The project involves:

- 🧹 **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**  
  - 📊 Loading the dataset and checking its structure and contents  
  - ❌ Handling missing values and removing duplicates  
  - ⚠️ Detecting and managing outliers in numeric and categorical data  

- 📈 **Data Analysis:**  
  - 🔗 Exploring relationships between numeric features and the target (exam scores) using correlation and visualization  
  - 🧩 Investigating categorical features and their impact on the target using group means and count plots  

- 🤖 **Modeling:**  
  - 📉 Training and evaluating two types of regression models:  
    - 🔹 **Linear Regression**  
    - 🔸 **Polynomial Regression (degree 2)**  
  - 🛠 Models trained on different feature sets:  
    - 🕒 Only study hours  
    - 🎯 A selected subset of relevant features  
    - 📚 All available features to maximize prediction accuracy  

- 📊 **Evaluation:**  
  - 🧪 Splitting data into training and testing sets for reliable model validation  
  - 📏 Using performance metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score to evaluate and compare models  

- 🎨 **Visualization:**  
  - 📉 Plotting feature distributions, regression fit lines, and correlation heatmaps to better understand the data and model performance
